    <h1>Travelling to Palestine</h1>
    <article>
        <p>Due to the ongoing Israeli occupation, Palestine does not have control over its border or points of entry and exit. The Yasser Arafat International Airport in Gaza which was officially opened on November 24th 1998 Airport has been severely destroyed and shut down by the Israeli Authorities since late 2000. Therefore, in order to travel to Palestine you must pass through Israel. There are multiple entry options to enter Israel and consequently reach destination Palestine.
            <br> Visitors to Jordan and Egypt can also easily visit Palestine through traveling through some of the below crossings points.</p>
        <h4>By Air:</h4>
        <p>Ben Gurion International Airport located between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Most international airlines operate flights to Israel. Furthermore, there are also daily flights between Israel and Jordan’s Queen Ali International Airport in Amman.</p>
        <h4>By Sea:</h4>
        <p>There are several shipping lines offering cruises that stop in Israel. The three main ports are Haifa, Ashdod and Eilat which are all within driving distance from Jerusalem, Jericho and other Palestinian cities.</p>
        <h4>By Land:</h4>
        <p>Currently, Israel only has diplomatic ties with Jordan and Egypt. Land crossings include:</p>
        <h4>To and from Jordan</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>The Allenby-King Hussein Bridge border crossing</li>
            <li>The Jordan River-Sheikh Hussein border crossing</li>
            <li>The Yitzhak Rabin-Arava border crossing</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>To & From Egypt</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>The Taba border crossing</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Denied Entry into Israel:</h4>
        <p>There have been some instances where visitors to Palestine were not allowed entry into Palestine. If for some reason you are denied entry, please make sure you visit</p>
        <a href=" http://www.righttoenter.ps/etemplate.php?id=70"> http://www.righttoenter.ps/etemplate.php?id=70</a><p>for updated information on what to do and who to contact.</p>
        <h4>Entry into Gaza</h4>
        <p>Exiting Gaza via the Erez crossing into Israel, which is tightly restricted by the Government of Israel, is nearly impossible. Exit through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt is unpredictable and can involve significant expense.</p>
        <h5>Relevant to Palestinian ID holders:</h5>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>Palestinian Authority Areas-Only Stamp. Anyone indicating at the Allenby Bridge-King Hussein border crossing that he or she has connections to the West Bank or plans to travel to the West Bank may be given an entry stamp that permits travel only in Palestinian Authority-controlled areas of the West Bank. This stamp does not permit such travelers to enter Jerusalem or Israel. Travelers who have received such a stamp may file an appeal with the Israeli military’s district coordination offices in the West Bank, but appeals are rarely approved.</li>
            <li>Palestinian ID holders Must Enter Through the Allenby Border Crossing. The Government of Israel does not currently permit foreign citizens with Palestinian nationality (or even, in some cases, the claim to it) to enter Israel via Ben Gurion International Airport. Many travelers have been sent back to their home country upon arrival. Others have been allowed to enter Israel but told they cannot depart Israel via Ben Gurion without special permission, which is rarely granted. Some families have been separated as a result, and other travelers have forfeited expensive airline tickets. If you believe that you may be affected by this rule, confirm with your local Israeli embassy before departure that you will be able to enter and depart through Ben Gurion. You may prefer to alter your travel plans to enter via the Allenby-King Hussein border crossing.</li>
